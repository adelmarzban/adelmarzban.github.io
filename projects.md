Smart Hydrogel for Wound Dressings {#smart-hydrogel}
Keywords: PNIPAm, Gelatin, Ce-UIO-66 MOF, Diclofenac, Shape Memory

This project focuses on designing responsive drug delivery systems. We developed a dual-network hydrogel featuring shape-memory behavior, optimized for controlled release of diclofenac. The inclusion of Ce-MOF nanoparticles (Ce-UIO-66) was performed in-situ to maximize drug loading capacity and tune the scaffold's degradation kinetics.

Key Outcomes
Successful synthesis of interpenetrating network (IPN) hydrogels.

Tunable pore size and high surface area achieved via MOF inclusion.

Demonstrated temperature- and pH-responsive drug release profile.

SEM Image Analysis Toolkit {#sem-analysis}
Keywords: ImageJ, Microscopy, Porosity, Morphology Metrics

This toolkit automates the quantitative analysis of microscopic images. It includes a suite of custom ImageJ macros designed to perform rapid, high-throughput analysis of porous biomaterials. This significantly reduces manual processing time and improves the statistical rigor of morphology studies.

Key Outcomes
Automated calculation of pore-size distribution histograms.

Quantification of morphology metrics like aspect ratio and circularity.

Workflow validated against standard reference materials.

AI for Biomedical Engineering: Predictive Modeling {#ai-biomed}
Keywords: Deep Learning, Release Kinetics, Tissue Engineering, Data Analytics

This work applies Deep Learning models to solve complex problems in biomaterials. Models are trained on experimental data to predict material behavior, suchs as drug release kinetics, without the need for extensive laboratory testing. This accelerates the design and optimization of tissue engineering scaffolds and drug carriers.

Key Outcomes
Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image-based tissue classification.

Implemented a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict long-term drug release profiles from initial material properties.

Creation of an interactive visualization dashboard for model results.
