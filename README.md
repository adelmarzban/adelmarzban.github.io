This is the body of your post, written in Markdown format.

2. Update Downloadable Resources
Place new documents (PDFs, PPTs, etc.) into the assets/pdfs/ folder.

Update the href links in index.html (specifically in the Tissue Engineering and Entrepreneurship sections) to point to the new file path.

üöÄ Getting Started (Local Development)
While the site runs entirely on GitHub Pages, if you wish to run it locally (especially to preview blog posts using Jekyll):

Install Ruby and Jekyll: Follow the official Jekyll documentation for your operating system.

üîç SEO & Verification
The site is configured for SEO best practices.

Google Search Console: The verification meta tag is placed in both index.html and _layouts/default.html for site-wide verification. Remember to replace YOUR_UNIQUE_CODE_FROM_GOOGLE with your actual code.
