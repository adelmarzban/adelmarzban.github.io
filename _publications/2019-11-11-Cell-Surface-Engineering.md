**Highlights**
This publication provides an overview of the complex interactions between cells and the surfaces of biomaterials, with a focus on polymeric substrates used in cell culture and tissue engineering. It explains that cell behavior—such as adhesion, spreading, proliferation, migration, differentiation, and functional activity—is strongly influenced by the chemical groups present on the surface, the adsorbed protein and water layer, and the physicochemical properties of the material. The review highlights how surface characteristics like roughness, charge, wettability, and topography modulate protein adsorption and, in turn, cell attachment and signaling. Special emphasis is placed on surface modification strategies, which can enhance the intrinsic properties of biomaterials, improve biocompatibility, and better guide desired cell responses. Overall, the article underscores the importance of understanding cell–surface interactions for designing more effective scaffolds and cell–tissue based products in regenerative medicine and biomaterials science.
