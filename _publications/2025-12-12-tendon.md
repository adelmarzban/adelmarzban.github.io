**Highlights**
This publication investigates the impact of gamma radiation—commonly used as a terminal sterilization method in tissue banking—on the structural and mechanical quality of freeze-dried bone and skin allografts. The results show substantial reductions in Young’s modulus and ultimate stress for both tissue types, indicating weakening of their load-bearing capacity. Biochemical analysis confirms notable decreases in hydroxyproline content, reflecting collagen degradation caused by irradiation. FTIR reveals modifications in amide and phosphate peaks consistent with collagen network disruption, while SEM imaging shows increased porosity and microstructural fragmentation. Together, these findings demonstrate that although gamma radiation effectively sterilizes allograft tissues, it can compromise their biomechanical performance. The study emphasizes the need to optimize irradiation parameters to ensure both sterility and functional integrity in musculoskeletal and reconstructive applications.
