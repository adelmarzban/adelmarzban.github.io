abstract: "Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is an antibiotic and immunosuppressive agent has been produced as a secondary metabolite of some fungi species such as Penicillium. In the present work, in the first step, mycophenolic acid production was performed in a fermentation process by Penicillium brevicompactum MUCL 19011 in shake flask using a base medium.
