abstract: "Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is an antibiotic and immunosuppressive agent has been produced as a secondary metabolite of some fungi species such as Penicillium. In the present work, in the first step, mycophenolic acid production was performed in a fermentation process by Penicillium brevicompactum MUCL 19011 in shake flask using a base medium.

**Highlights**
In this study, a fungal species called Penicillium brevicompactum was grown in controlled fermentation systems. The research showed that when the growth medium was enriched with a specific amount of L-isoleucine, the fungus produced over 30% more MPA compared to the standard conditions. This improvement is important because MPA is used worldwide in medicine, especially for preventing organ-transplant rejection and treating viral and inflammatory conditions.

Through this work, we demonstrated expertise in fermentation engineering, microbial metabolism, and process optimization—fields that play a key role in developing more efficient and scalable biotechnological products.
