**Highlights**
This publication addresses the growing need for safe and effective facial soft tissue fillers for correcting dermal defects caused by disease, trauma, or aging. The authors fabricate an injectable hydrogel composed of micronized human-derived decellularized dermal collagen combined with carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), a biocompatible, degradable polysaccharide used here to enhance biomechanical performance. Human skin from deceased donors is decellularized via chemical and enzymatic protocols, lyophilized, milled to defined particle sizes, and sterilized by gamma irradiation. CMC is similarly sterilized and dissolved to prepare a 3% solution, which is mixed with collagen fibrils at different ratios. Histological (H&E) staining confirms effective cell removal from the dermis, while MTT assays demonstrate good cytocompatibility. Rheological tests show that adding CMC increases storage modulus and elasticity, while reducing viscosity and lowering the force required for injection, thus improving handling and clinical usability. Based on these biological and mechanical results, the authors conclude that the collagen/CMC hydrogel is a promising candidate as an injectable filler and substitute material for skin tissue engineering and soft tissue augmentation.
