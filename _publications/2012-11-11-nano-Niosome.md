abstract: "A nano-niosomal formulation of deferoxamine was developed that provides sustained drug release, high entrapment efficiency, and reduced toxicity compared to the free drug. It showed superior iron-chelating efficacy in hepatocytes, suggesting strong potential as an improved intravenous delivery system for deferoxamine."

**Highlights**
Deferoxamine has been widely used as an iron-chelating agent in patients with primary or secondary iron overload deficiency. Deferoxamine is typically administered subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intravenously by the constant infusion of the drug over 8–12 h. This process is lengthy and uncomfortable for the patients. A nano-niosomal form of deferoxamine was prepared using the reverse phase evaporation method and evaluated on the basis of morphology, drug release, cytotoxicity, and iron-chelating efficacy to compare with free drug formulation. The unique structure of niosome enables sustained release of the drug over extended periods. The average particle size was 136 nm and the entrapment efficiency was about 96 %. The biocompatibility of the drug-loaded nanoparticles showed that the encapsulation of the drug in nano-niosomes reduces the toxicity of the drug significantly. Our results indicate that the iron-chelating ability of the entrapped deferoxamine in hepatocytes is higher than the free drug. The nano-niosomal drug form showed more efficacies versus the free one and it could be a promising clinical intravenous system for delivery of iron-chelating drugs such as deferoxamine.
