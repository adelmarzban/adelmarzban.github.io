**Highlights**
This publication focuses on overcoming key limitations of conventional polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) bone cement, including its poor bioactivity, relatively high polymerization heat, and restricted mechanical performance. The authors develop a modified cement formulation by incorporating chitosan (Ch) and human-derived allograft bone powder (BP), both chosen for their bioactive and osteoconductive properties. The composite PMMA-Ch-BP cement is fabricated via solvent casting, and its structure and morphology are characterized using FTIR and SEM. Mechanical testing reveals a notable 26.77% increase in compressive strength relative to standard PMMA, while a 15.22 °C decrease in polymerization temperature suggests a reduced risk of thermal damage to surrounding tissues. In vitro assays demonstrate enhanced biocompatibility, with the modified cement reaching approximately 120% cell viability versus unmodified PMMA by day 5, alongside improved cell attachment and spreading observed in SEM imaging. Overall, the results indicate that PMMA-Ch-BP is a promising next-generation bone cement with superior osteoconductive potential, better mechanical performance, and safer thermal behavior for orthopedic applications.
