**Highlights**
This publication reviews the central role of the mevalonate cascade—a metabolic pathway crucial for cholesterol synthesis and many cellular functions—in the pathophysiology of brain diseases. It explains how drugs that act on this pathway, particularly statins and Rho GTPase inhibitors, may offer therapeutic benefits beyond cholesterol lowering, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and signaling-modulatory effects. Because both drug classes converge on the mevalonate pathway, they share mechanisms that could protect neural cells and improve outcomes in neurodegenerative conditions (such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease) as well as neurodevelopmental disorders. The article synthesizes current evidence and proposes mechanistic models for how modulation of this pathway could be leveraged for future CNS therapies.
