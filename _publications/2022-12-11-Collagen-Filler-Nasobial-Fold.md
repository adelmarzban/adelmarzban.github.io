**Highlights**
This publication presents a quasi-experimental clinical assessment of allogenic (human-derived) collagen gel for treating nasolabial folds—facial lines that strongly influence perceived age and self-confidence. Conducted at Imam Hospital between 2016–2017, the study included patients seeking outpatient, rapid-recovery aesthetic treatment without age or gender restrictions. The collagen gel was injected into the nasolabial folds, and improvements were evaluated by the treating researcher, an independent neutral examiner, and the patients themselves using two standardized measures: the Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale (WSRS) and the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS). Prior to treatment, most participants presented with moderate to severe folds. Post-treatment assessments showed that over 80% of patients experienced noticeable improvement, with strong agreement between evaluators (K = 0.73, P < 0.001). The filler’s effectiveness lasted approximately 4–6 months. The results support allogenic collagen gel as a relatively safe, cost-effective, and practical option for short- to mid-term management of nasolabial folds, requiring no allergy testing and posing minimal contamination risk.
