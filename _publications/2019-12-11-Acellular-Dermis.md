abstract: "This study describes the development and sterilization of an acellular dermis (ADM) collagen membrane produced by ITP (Regen Allograft) as a bioresorbable allograft for wound coverage, offering a safe alternative to autografts.

**Highlights**
The publication presents the preparation and properties of ITP’s acellular dermis, a freeze-dried type I collagen membrane designed for clinical use as a wound dressing and graft substitute. The membrane is mechanically strong, tear-resistant, flexible, and adhesive, allowing it to conform easily to defect size. After chemical processing and rinsing with triple-distilled water to remove additives, the material is lyophilized, packaged under sterile conditions, and terminally sterilized with 25 kGy gamma irradiation. By removing epidermal and dermal cells while preserving the collagen, elastin, and bioactive matrix proteins, the ADM supports revascularization, cell proliferation, and tissue remodeling. The authors conclude that this bioresorbable allograft represents a safe and effective alternative to traditional autografts for soft-tissue reconstruction and wound management.
